Why do you have missing data – is it random or not random?
	For example, in proteomics, data can be missing because its lowly expressed (not random) or a post-translational modification changed its mass (random).

Should I impute ?
-	You should have no more than 25% missing data
-	Works better if imputing replicates (ie same condition, treatment, etc) rather than imputing for example human variation
-	At times, performing classification without imputation yields the ost accurate classification  think about your data

Imputation Methods
1.	Single digit replacement
2.	Imputation on local structures
3.	Imputation on global structures

Single digit replacement
-	Replace missing value by a constant or a randomly selected value
-	Generally have lower performance
-	Perform better in presence of left-censored missing values (low intensity data)
-	Common approaches
o	Half of the minimum intensity among peptides
o	Half of the minimum intensity of individual peptide
o	Random draw from a truncated normal distribution – calculate parameter k to allow the truncated distribution to merge into the left tail of the base distribution without yielding a bimodal distrubition via recursive visualization of imputed values

Local Similarity Approaches
-	Estimate missing values based on expression profile of several other peptides with similar peptide intensity profiles in the same dataset
-	Generally perform the best 
o	In proteomics, regularized expectation maximization and least-squares adaptive algorithms were most accurate and robust
-	Must make assumption that genes/proteins are regulated dependently and that highly correlated expression behaviors are normally observed with coregulated genes/proteins
-	2 steps – select “close” peptides and then impute target peptide by weighted combination of the neighboring peptides
-	Many different approaches
o	K nearest neighbors – weighted average intensity of K most similar peptides
o	Local least squares – least-squares estimation of multiple regression based on K similar peptides
o	Least squares adaptive – weight average of peptidewise and saplewise estimation with the most correlated peptides
o	Regularized expectation maximization – iterative process of linear regression with ridge regression
o	Model based imputation – random selection based on censoring probability from ANOVA model parameters

Global Structure Approaches
-	Probabilistic principal component analysis – missing values and PCA are viewed as model aparemeters which implemented as maximum liklehood estimates of the model paremters via and EM algorithm
-	Bayesion principal component analysis – above but uses a Bayesian estimation to fit a PPCA model (high processing intensive)
