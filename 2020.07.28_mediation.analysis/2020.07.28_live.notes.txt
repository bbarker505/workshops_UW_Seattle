# Mediation analysis in R

How much of the effect of A on B is mediated/explained by C?

A ---> B
 \    ^
  v  /
   C
   
## Outputs

* ACME= average causal mediation effects
    - indirect effect of A on B that is explained by C
* ADE = average direct effects
    - direct effect A on B when controlling for C
* Total Effect 
    - direct + indirect (e.g. ACM + ADE)
* Proportion Mediated 
    - proportion of effect of A on B that goes through C (e.g. ACME / total effect)

## Recommendations and cautions

* Be sure of the modeled directionality
* Only test specific hypotheses, not every combo
* Best to only test when A--->B is significant
* Be wary of the P-values - effect size is more important
